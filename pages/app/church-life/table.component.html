                &emsp;The Table is Concord Community Church's new online community. It's a tool for prayer, connection, sharing, and spiritual growth. As it develops, it will increasingly become the place to find other members, small groups, ministries, serving opportunities, growth tools, and more. It's the place to learn about prayer requests and post needs of your own. Plus we'll be adding great local content like videos and podcasts of the weekend message, photos, and discussions. The Table helps us be the church 24/7.<br/><br/>

                <h3>Ten Cool Things to Do</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pray for others</b> on the Prayer page. Send a note and let them know you're praying for them. Or ask for a prayer and let others pray with and for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Find folks who live nearby</b> using the Maps feature. Send them a quicknote just to say "hi." Organize a potluck to get to know your Concord Corps neighbors better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Catch up on a sermon</b> you may have missed by watching the video on the Table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Set up a Growth Group or Ministry Team page</b> and use it to keep in touch with folks between meetings. Note that all participants in the Table must be members or regular attenders of Concord Community Church.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Read the Bible</b> using the 365 Daily Bible Reading app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Create a photo album</b>, then upload some of your favorite church pictures to share with others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Start a conversation</b>, ask questions, or get in on a discussion about the Bible, theology, or weekend message.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Post ministry, service, or job opportunities.</b> Check out what others have posted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Share your stuff.</b> Click <a href="http://tableproject.org/10-ways-the-serve-app-can-get-you-sharing/">here </a>for some ideas to get you started. (You can ignore the snowmobile/snowblower suggestions, but you just might have a tennis racket or surfboard you'd like to share instead.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Customize your Table page</b> by adding apps of your choice with the My Page app.

                &emsp;The Table is not a Christian version of Facebook. It's a private social network that's meant to build on and extend the sense of community we already enjoy in our church family. It's about conversation, intimacy, encouragement, sharing, and involvement. It's not meant to replace real-life, personal contact, but to facilitate and enhance it. You don't need to be experienced in social media to sign on to The Table. Check it out and explore how it can help you connect with others. If it's not for you, that's ok. But we do encourage you to take advantage of the other ways there are to connect at Concord Community Church.
