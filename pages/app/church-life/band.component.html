                &emsp;In 1882 the Salvation Army established its first outpost on the West Coast of the United States in the city of Oakland, California. Quite soon after the Oakland Citadel Corps was opened a British-style brass band was formed. This band continued to be active in Oakland for more than a hundred years until January 1994, when the English-speaking Corps relocated to Concord - a suburban location about 15 miles north of Oakland &ndash; leaving a Korean and Hispanic ministry to continue to serve the Oakland community.<br /><br />&emsp;The Concord Band consists of 38 players who range from 14 years through to seniors! A broad spectrum of occupations is represented in the Band personnel &ndash; including Salvation Army Officers, a school teacher, Police Officers, Insurance brokers, travel agent, contractors, school and college students, homemaker, full time employees of The Salvation Army and retired executives.&nbsp; All these members volunteer their time and are unpaid for their service in the Band.<br /><br />&emsp;The primary function of the Band is to accompany congregational singing at the Concord Community Church during worship services every Sunday at 11:00 AM. The Band is often invited to present concerts at other churches and Salvation Army Centers, and has traveled extensively in the contiguous United States, Hawaii, United Kingdom, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and most recently as one of only two bands ever to be invited to march in the Festival de La Luce parade in Costa Rica. It ranks as one of the premier bands in the Western Territory of The Salvation Army.&nbsp;<br /><br />&emsp;The band's current bandmaster is Jim Black who has been the band's leader for the past 15 years. Previously, Jim was the choir director (Songster Leader) for the church for ten years before taking responsibility for the band.
        The band has made several recordings over the years and these can be obtained by contacting the Band Treasurer <a href="mailto:joejunehaughin@aol.com">here</a>, but most of our work is for Sunday worship and we present a selection of recent live offerings here.
